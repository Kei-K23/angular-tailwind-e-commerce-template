# Angular E-commerce Template üõçÔ∏è

This is a modern, responsive e-commerce template built with **Angular** and **TailwindCSS**. It's designed to be a starting point for building full-featured e-commerce applications. The template includes a clean and customizable design, ideal for minimalist online stores.

‚ùóÔ∏èThis template is still under development.
I'm trying my best to be able to deliver this template with quality. After finishing some percentage of UI part, I'm also planning to start building my own Backend. So, please stay tuned.‚ùóÔ∏è

## Features üöÄ

- **Responsive Layout**: Fully responsive design optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Angular Components**: Modular structure with reusable Angular components.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for fast styling and leverage with **Daisy UI**.
- **Product Listings**: Showcase products with detailed views. (Partially developing)
- **Shopping Cart**: Add products to the cart, view items, and proceed to checkout.

- **Authentication Pages**: Pre-built login, register, and password recovery pages. (Still developing)
- **Pre-configured Environment**: Ready-to-use Angular and TailwindCSS setup for fast development.

## Tech Stack

- **Angular 19 (Signal + SPA)**
